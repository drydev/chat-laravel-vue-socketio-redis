# Laravel 5.3 Chat application using Socket.IO, Redis, Vue.js and Event Broadcasting

This is simple chat application using standard libraries except 'laravel-echo-server' which I think completely unnecessary.

## Installation

Clone this repository into your machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/gdbhosale/chat-laravel-socketio-redis-vuejs.git
```
